A game of crystals and guessing their worth!


This game is very fun and very simple and for all ages! Anyone can play!

 Here's how the game works:

   * There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

   * You will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

   * When you click on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points (a random number between 1 - 12) to the your total score. 

     * The game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
     * When you do click one, your score counter will update.

   * You if your total score matches the random number (any number between 
   19 - 120) from the beginning of the game.

   * You lose if your score goes above the random number.

   * The game restarts whenever you win or lose.

     * When the game begins again, you will see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, your score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

   * This game will show the number of games the your have won and lost. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.



Good luck and have fun!
